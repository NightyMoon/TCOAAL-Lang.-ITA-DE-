# TCOAAL Languages ITA-DE
Official translation of “The Coffin of Andy and Leyley” into Italian and German, constantly updated.

Hi, I decided to create this project in order to give accessibility and convenience to players who will want to use their native language in the game “The Coffin of Andy and LeyLey”

The project will continue to be updated for any future chapters of the game.
